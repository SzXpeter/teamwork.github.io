                <p>
                Push is a brand new gamemode for Overwatch 2 and sees two teams fight to guide a robot to the opponent’s base. The robot is active when a team is standing by it and will push a barricade closer to the opposing team’s base. Whoever gets the robot the furthest towards their opponent’s side wins the match.

                <p>
                    Control is the classic game mode from Overwatch that sees players on two teams try to seize a single objective point on the map. Each round in a control match begins on a new map and the first to win two out of three of the rounds and reach 100% capture in each of them, wins.

                    <h2>Escort</h2>
                    <p>
                        Escort is a payload mode where the attacking team has to guide a payload to the goal, with the defending team trying to halt their progress. The attacking team has multiple checkpoints within an Escort match, which can extend the time they have to reach the final goal. In Competitive, attacking and defending teams alternate every round and the team who delivers the payload the closest to the goal wins.

                <p>
                    Hybrid modes are a combination of both Control and Escort. In this match, an attacking team fights with defenders to win control of an objective point. Once taken, the match then switches to Escort and the attackers have to deliver a payload to the goal. Competitive works the same here as in Escort and the team that delivers the payload the furthest win.
