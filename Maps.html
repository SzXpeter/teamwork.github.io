                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rather than rushing straight from your spawn room onto the objective point at the start of the round, consider leading your team along an alternate route. For example, on the Sanctuary map, move up to the drum by the coast first. If the enemy team has moved to take point, you now have height advantage as you press your attack. The same goes for both platforms above the objective on MEKA Base.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The alternate routes to the objective point on all three Busan maps tend to be rather narrow. Heroes with “zoning” abilities tend to get a lot of utility on Busan for this reason. Consider using Sojourn’s Disruptor Shot to ensare enemies in tight corridors, Mei’s Ice Wall to cut off an enemy player’s escape, or Zarya’s Graviton Surge Ultimate, which will pull in and trap any nearby enemies for your team to finish off.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Even if you do not choose to play Lucio as a Support, consider choosing him in the spawn room to use his Speed Boost to rush your team towards the objective, before swapping back to the Support of your choice. In general, Lucio is always a good Support pick for Control maps, where recontesting the objective is crucial.

                    <li>
                        All of the Ilios maps, but particularly Lighthouse and Well, are ideal for flying heroes. Pharah and Echo would pair well with Support hero on Mercy to “pocket” or focusing all their healing and damage boosting onto them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heroes with knockback abilities are a great pick for Ilios as well, as each of the three maps has maximum potential to knock enemy players off the map. Lucio, Pharah, D.va, and even Zenyatta are all fantastic hero picks for this reason, as are Roadhog and Junker Queen, who both have abilities that can drag enemy players off the map with the perfect positioning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sniper Damage heroes such as Widowmaker and Hanzo are a popular pick on the Ilios Ruins map. Ruins is a very open map with long sightlines. Travel across the map using cover to avoid getting sniped from afar.
                    </li>

                        Even if you do not choose to play Lucio as a Support, consider choosing him in the spawn room to use his Speed Boost to rush your team towards the objective, before swapping back to the Suppot of your choice. In general, Lucio is always a good Support pick for Control maps, where recontesting the objective is crucial.

                        Flying heroes such as Pharah and Echo excel on the three Lijiang Towers maps. Control Center, Garden, and Night Market are all rather open maps with high ceilings, giving you an excellent angle on the enemy team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In Control Center, consider moving your team to the connecting room beside the objective point before taking the objective. Even if you do not clash with the enemy team in this connector area, you will have some high-ground advantage before you rush the point.

                        Damage heroes who have strong flanking capabilities will do well on all three Nepal maps. Reaper, Tracer, or Sombra can quickly dash into an enemy team’s backline without being seen thanks to all the cover the Nepal maps provide.

                        Yet another great Control map for fliers, Pharah and Echo will get a lot of advantage on Oasis, particularly in City Center and Gardens. The areas surrounding the objectives are nice and open, making any hero with high vertical mobility a great choice.

                    <li>
                        Flanking Damage heroes can see a lot of success on the University Oasis map, where there are lots of corridors with narrow sightlines that lead up to the objective - including underground passageways near each spawn room that lead to a room beneath the objective that accesses the point.

                        As the Defending team, you might want to position yourselves at the start of the match near the enemy spawn room. If you unable to hold the enemy team here, however, you will need to quickly back up. Choosing heroes with high mobility or vertical mobility will allow you to swiftly take the high ground above the cafe that is on the payload’s route.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pharah or Echo are smart hero picks on the Attacking team, as the start of the Circuit Royal map is quite narrow. Sending a flier into the enemy’s backline can disrupt the Defending team’s position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With three teammates on the payload, the payload will move along the objective route much quicker than with only one. That being said, if your team needs to push up to cut off the enemy team’s advance, consider leaving a teammate on the payload with either long sightlines (Widowmaker or Ana) or high mobility should they need to catch up with the team in a pinch (Lucio or Solider: 76)

                        Tank heroes with shields, such as Reinhardt or Sigma, can help the defending team move the payload along quickly. Placing yourself or your shield ahead of the payload creates more space for the rest of your team to play in with relative safety.

                    <li>
                        Sniper or flier Damage heroes will do well on Dorado. There is plenty of high-ground platforms that heroes with vertical mobility can take advantage of, plus long sightlines you can abuse, particularly on after the payload has made it past Point A.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On Defense, consider setting up on the high ground platforms near the enemy team’s spawn room. The payload must pass under the bridge in order to progress to Point A, and taking this position gives you the advantage while they attempt to travel along the route.

                        On the Defending team, be on the lookout for flankers constantly. Rialto has many alternate routes that the Attacking team can use to move around you and strike your backline.

                    <li>
                        With three teammates on the payload, the payload will move along the objective route much quicker than with only one. That being said, if your team needs to push up to cut off the enemy team’s advance, consider leaving a teammate on the payload with either long sightlines (Widowmaker or Ana) or high mobility should they need to catch up with the team in a pinch (Lucio or Solider: 76)

                    <li>
                        On the Attack, the key to pushing the payload past the first checkpoint is to force the enemy team out of position. Do this by sending Damage heroes into their backline to flank and pick off weak Supports, or by saving up enough Ultimates to overwhelm the enemy team. Be careful not to expend too many Ultimates though!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the start of your Defense, positioning your team mostly on top of the gas station by the first checkpoint is ideal. You have a good angle on the approaching payload as it rounds the corner, and this position also keeps every other avenue a flanker might use easily within your line of sight.

                        Heroes with vertical mobility are the ultimate pick for Watchpoint: Gibraltar. Consider picking a flier like Pharah or Echo, and a Mercy to pair with them. Genji, Hanzo, and Kiriko are great choices as well for their Wall Climbing abilities.

                    <li>
                        As the Defending team, it might be tempting to stay on the high ground as the enemy pushes the payload up to the first checkpoint. However, once they succeed in escorting the payload under the bridge, you have officially lost the advantage. Consider dropping down onto the other side of the bridge, facing the enemy spawn, so you continue to give yourself the high-ground advantage.

                        The hardest part of being the Attacking team on any Hybrid map is capturing that first objective. If your team is struggling to push past the enemy, build up your Ultimates and coordinate which ones you plan to use in order to overwhelm the enemy team.

                    <li>
                        There is plenty of high-ground platforms to be found in Blizzard World. On the Defense, try to position yourself on the high ground whenever possible. This gives you the ideal vantage not only for picking off incoming players but a better view of potential flankers.

                        Taking the first point as the Attacking team is rough on Eichenwalde, as your team tends to funnel under the bridge, with few options for flanking. Picking a flier hero such as Pharah or Echo, and coupling them with a Mercy, is a good choice to help get the enemy team out of position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In general, forming an Attack team with a “Dive” composition is a good move on Eichenwalde. Tank heroes such as Wrecking Ball, D.va, and Winston can jump into the enemy team’s front line, disrupting their positioning with relative ease.

                        On Defense, sniper heroes such as Widowmaker and Hanzo can take advantage of the high ground platforms surrounding Point A. Even mid-range Damage heroes such as Sojourn and Soldier: 76 can gain a lot by peppering enemies on the approach, building up Ultimate charge quickly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consider moving through the security room or through the alley to the back of the objective, rather than pressing straight forward on the Attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you are still having trouble reaching the point before being gunned down, you might want to swap to heroes that suit a “Dive” composition, such as Wrecking Ball, D.va, or Winston to take back high-ground advantage from the Defenders.

                    <li>
                        The most direct path is not always the best path. On the Attack, lead your team around the right side of the statue, or even through the hotel to the left before moving onto the point. This cuts off your enemies’ line of sight, even if only briefly. Use Lucio’s Speed Boost or Junker Queen’s Commanding Shout in order to rotate to the objective quickly and catch the enemy team by surprise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The route the payload takes through King’s Row is narrow, making it easier for Tank heroes with shields, such as Reinhardt and Sigma, to “zone” or cut off incoming Attackers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mei’s Ice Wall ability can also be incredibly useful on Defense. Place it behind a retreating Tank or other hero to cut off their escape.

                        On the Defensive team, take full advantage of how tall the payload itself is by positioning yourself around the payload.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shield heroes and other heroes with “zoning” abilities will see a huge advantage on Midtown, where so many passageways are easily cut off. Consider picking Tanks such as Reinhardt or Sigma, or Damage heroes like Sojourn or Mei.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the Attacking team succeeds in getting the payload into Grand Central Terminal, consider swapping to a Damage hero who is superior at flanking, such as Reaper, Tracer, or Sombra. The narrow corridors of the train station will give these heroes a huge advantage on Defense.

                        The high ground surrounding the first point of Numbani is too good for your team not to ultiize it. On Defense, consider splitting your team up across both sides of the point for the ultimate vantage point. Heroes with high mobility, such as Genji, Pharah, or even Mercy should have no problem repositioning to the other high ground in a pinch if their teammates need help.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While on the Defending team, it can be tempting to chase the enemy team all the way back to their spawn, especially when you feel that you have the advantage. Do not risk overextending, especially when the enemy team might have the Ultimate advantage. If you are caught out of position, it only takes a few well-timed enemy Ultimates to cost you the first point.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You want to pick high mobility heroes on the Attack, particularly when capturing Point A. Chances are that the enemy team will be set up on the high ground. Your best chance at securing the point is to force them off the high ground platforms or force them out of position compelling them to meet you on the objective itself.

                        Choosing a flier hero such as Pharah or Echo, or any hero with vertical mobility such as Hanzo, Genji, or even Widowmaker, puts you at the advantage in Paraiso.

                    <li>
                        It is only fitting that Lucio’s hometown map should have so much opportunity for Wall Riding. Lucio is a fantastic pick for Paraiso, especially on Attack while attempting to capture the objective point.

                        Heroes who excel at flanking, such as Reaper, Tracer, or Sombra will thrive on Paraiso. There are tons of alleys and other alternative routes along the route the payload takes, giving your ample opportunity to sneak into the enemy team’s backline.

                        The quickest route to contest the Robot at its initial start location is not along the route the Robot travels. Instead, cut through the corridors just down the avenue from each team’s spawn room. Having a Lucio or a Junker Queen on your team to boost your movement speed can give your team a huge headstart.

                    <li>
                        Flanking heroes such as Reaper, Tracer, or Sombra can do especially well on the first contest of Esperanca. With their mobility, these heroes can easily flank around the tower by the Robot’s start location to get the drop on the enemy’s backline.

            <h3>Tips for playing New Queen Street</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Once your team has taken the Robot, consider saving the majority of your team’s Ultimates in order to overwhelm the enemy team right before you take the first checkpoint. Securing this checkpoint unlocks a better spawn room to help your team recontest the Robot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On the first push to contest the Robot, rather than following the route directly to the starting point, cut through the shops and down the stairs to reach the Robot swiftly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fliers such as Pharah or Echo, or other heroes with high mobility like Genji, Hanzo, or Kiriko, are all great picks for New Queen Street. Being able to dive over the covered bridge at the center of the map can give your team the advantage to gain control of the Robot first.
                    </li>
